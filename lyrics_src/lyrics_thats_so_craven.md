I crept through your garden\
Hoping I would feel at ease\
Being out here amongst something\
That I know had brought you peace\
And I promise I've been trying\
To do it like you showed me\
But I have been\
Rejected by its leaves\
\
And I know you knew I loved you\
But I wish I'd said it more\
Because I have this awful feeling\
That you died feeling ignored\
And it's so fucking typical\
While everybody grieves\
I find a way to make it about me\
\
So was it hard to say goodbye\
And have to do so with a brave face\
While the people you look up to\
Cry and wish they could take your place\
Did that make you feel loved\
Or did it just make you feel guilty\
That's enough\
I'm not ready to know\
\
And I dragged my\
Feet across your hallway\
Hoping I'd melt through the floor\
Before I made it to your bedroom\
And have a stand off with your door\
I've never been in there without you\
Who know if it's even still there\
I tuck my tail\
And retreat downstairs\
\
So was it hard to say goodbye\
And have to do so with a brave face\
While the people you look up to\
Cry and wish they could take your place\
Did that make you feel loved\
Or did it just make you feel guilty\
That's enough\
I'm not ready to know\
\
And I\
Couldn't be more of a coward\
If I were to try\
Cause When you needed closure\
I wouldn't let you say goodbye\
And I thought that was noble\
At least at the time\
As if you needed someone\
To tell you you're fine\
As if not letting go of you\
Would have somehow saved your life\
\
So was it hard to say goodbye\
And have to do so with a brave face\
While the people you look up to\
Cry and wish they could take your place\
Did that make you feel loved\
Or did it just make you feel guilty\
That's enough\
I'm not ready to know\
\
So was it hard to say goodbye\
And have to do so with a brave face\
While the people you look up to\
Cry and wish they could take your place\
Did that make you feel loved\
Or did it just make you feel guilty\
That's enough\
I don't ever wanna know\
