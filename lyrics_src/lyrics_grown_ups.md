Woke up with a sad song stuck in my head\
A crazy case of bittersweet dread\
A nasty constant biting affliction\
Nostalgia is the new addiction\
\
Walls creak with warmth of the morning\
And my knees ache from the concrete floor\
Subtlety be damned, I'm really tired\
Need something more to stoke my fire\
\
I hesitate to say I hate getting older\
\
Even grown ups have to grow up sometimes\
It's no surprise to eyes as weary as mine\
You could go on and still wonder why\
All time that's past remains by your side\
What matters most is making the most of it all\
\
I felt a familiar feeling\
The hole in my heart is still healing\
A drop in the temp about a dozen percent\
A change in the air I'll never forget\
\
I hesitate to say I hate getting older\
Turning the page, finding value with age\
The memories should remain\
Take the weight off your shoulders\
\
Even grown ups have to grow up sometimes\
It's no surprise to eyes as weary as mine\
You could go on and still wonder why\
All time that's past remains by your side\
What matters most is making the most of it all\
