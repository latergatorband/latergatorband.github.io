I wish I could sleep all night\
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff\
I wish I could put up a fight\
Until I can figure this shit out\
I'll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights\
It's getting bad again\
\
I'm losing track of where I've been\
Trying harder to form sentences\
I take forever to type\
My words aren't right\
Already guilty I won't make sense\
\
I'm losing weight again\
I'm carrying too much tension in my face\
I'm learning to smile softer\
My clothes hang harder\
I can't keep up this pace\
\
A broken clock\
Proud of myself\
For being right on the second pass\
And refusing all your help\
This mental atrophy\
From prescription crutches in my brain\
You think that I'm a mosaic when all I am\
Is just shattered glass\
\
I wish I could sleep all night\
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff\
I wish I could put up a fight\
Until I can figure this shit out\
I'll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights\
\
I wish I could sleep all night\
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff\
I wish I could put up a fight\
Until I can figure this shit out\
I'll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights\
It's getting bad again\
