I'm just the third beer you had last night\
A forgotten step along the way\
From here to a better time\
Like it could ever stay the same\
I'm far too concerned with consistency\
Eat the lotus and leave me behind\
The apathy is yours\
And the memories are now\
Only mine\
\
Fuck this\
I would have thought by now\
I wouldn't be getting left out of\
Everything we do\
I wish\
I would have learned by now\
To stop seeking validation\
From those don't give a single shit about me\
I'm still\
A nearly limitless\
Pool for your expectations\
And I am damn near done\
\
Even with all of us in the same room\
It doesn't feel the same anymore\
I used to act the oldest in the group\
But I haven't aged a day in years\
Foolishly convinced that to stay the same is the key\
For friends to stay with me\
\
I'm just the third beer you had last night\
A forgotten step along the way\
From here to a better time\
Like it could ever stay the same\
I know you'll keep staying out on your island\
And I'll keep staying in on mine\
Trying to find some joy in\
(Even when I'm always there, I'm still)\
Missing out\
