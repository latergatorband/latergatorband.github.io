My brain begged my mouth to say
I don't wanna lose you
Maybe if I said it sooner
This would not have been an issue
But it's hard so hard
Watching friendships fall apart
Knowing if it's not the distance
Then at least it's how it starts

My lungs implored my hands
To put down the pack of true blues.
I try casting smokescreen
But my excuses are see-through
I don't want to make things hard
I'm just spineless and I'm confused
Sending signals in the dark
And acting shocked they don't get seen too

I've been smoking Cigarettes
To spend time with your Silhouette
Cause I'm nervous I'll forget
What you looked like if I quit

You used to talk about
What our lives would look like on TV
I thought my role would be boring
But you always disagreed
What a shame they wrote you off
When you were only thirty-three
Really think you would have shined
With some more time on our screen

I've been smoking Cigarettes
To spend time with your Silhouette
Cause I'm nervous I'll forget
What you looked like if I quit
