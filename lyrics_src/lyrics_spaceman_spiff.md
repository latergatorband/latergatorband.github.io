How can I say\
I wanna be true to my pathway\
You always set me up for failure\
By dressing me in a suit not tailored\
\
Boy does it sting\
To constantly feel need to prove something\
Is it so hard to not be labeled\
Minding your own is off the table\
\
Reject this\
Cast out\
Misfit\
I shout\
\
Be what you wanna be\
I wanna be myself\
Be what you wanna be\
I won't be compelled\
\
Eyes upon me\
Despite the glare I feel no shame\
I don't care for peer approval\
Consider this cultural refusal\
\
Boy does it sting\
To constantly feel need to prove something\
Is it so hard to not be labeled\
Minding your own is off the table\
\
Why must I answer your questions\
When you interrogate in my face\
You're just a poser to sign up for\
Cause after cause\
\
I resist your insistence\
Every campaign every push\
I'll forever be dancing to\
My own drum\
\
Be what you wanna be\
I wanna be myself\
Be what you wanna be\
I won't be compelled\
