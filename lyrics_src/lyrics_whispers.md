Conscious thought has evaded\
All these years that I've waited\

Wanting\
In unrest\
These arrows\
In my chest\

I capture the reflection of today\
As the sky shines down my face\
All the raindrops cry out your name\
And it whispers, it whispers\

I shrugged too many shoulders to count\
Perhaps you've chosen this moment to pounce\

Upon me\
Fawning\
Horizons\
Are dawning\

And I capture the reflection of today\
As the sky shines down on my face\
All the raindrops cry out your name\
And it whispers, and it whispers\

And I capture the reflection of today\
As the sky shines down on my face\
All the raindrops cry out your name\
And it whispers, and it whispers\

And I capture the reflection of today\
As the sky shines down on my face\
All the raindrops cry out your name\
And it whispers, and it whispers\
