I was lost in the wind\
When I found you again\
Every spring since then\
I have welcomed the breeze again\

I lost my breath into the bargain\
Striking a deal with my dreams\
I lost myself in the bar again\
Nothing changes but me\

Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and\
I don't know where to call our home\
Where to call our home\
I'll just call you\

Whether we're traveling fast or slow\
We've already laid the track ahead\
I hate the change but you long to go\
The pause we took here's just a means to an end\

We caught a glimpse of a better time\
I lost my pace, I lost my spine\
We've barely made it out of town\
But somehow I'm ready to slow this down\

Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and\
I don't know where to call our home\
Where to call our home\
I'll just call you home\
