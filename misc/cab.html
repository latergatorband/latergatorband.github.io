<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>There’s a ton of design work that <em>can</em> go into building
guitar cabinets like is done for Hi-Fi speakers, with things like <a
href="">Thiele-Small parameters</a> and <a
href="https://www.audiocircle.com/index.php?topic=46637.0">using the
Golden Ratio for the enclosure dimensions</a>. I spent a while looking
into all of this, but it seemed like the lo-fi and non-linear nature of
guitar speakers means that, at least for a closed-back cabinet that I
was looking to build, the dimensions of the cabinet did not matter
much.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I still opted to start with a golden ratio design
and then work from there to make the cabinet easy to build. I wanted the
cabinet to be 25” wide to match the amp head I built previously, and I
calculated the other dimensions from there. Setting 25” as the long
dimension, this gives dimensions of</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Width: 25”</li>
<li>Height: 25 / 1.6 = 15.625”</li>
<li>Depth: 15.625” x 0.6 = 9.375”</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the 25” measurement was an external one, I wanted to ensure
that there was at least 9” of internal depth to give the speaker plenty
of room relative to the input jack. This fit well with using a pine 1x12
(actual 3/4” by 11 1/4”) for the frame.</p>
<p>Though internal volume is the number that actually makes a difference
in the speaker response, it was easy enough to calculate the external
volume and use that as a point of comparison to other popular 1x12
extension cabinets. The above specs result in an external volume of 4394
in^3, which is less than the huge closed back 1x12 from Emperor, but
also a decent bit larger than the Bogner Cube (although that’s ported
for additional low end response). A large cabinet might have resulted in
a slightly better bass response but again, these things don’t seem to
make much of a difference for guitar speakers and the midrange focus of
electric guitar.</p>
