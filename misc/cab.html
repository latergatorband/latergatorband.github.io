<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>There’s a ton of design work that <em>can</em> go into building
guitar cabinets like is done for Hi-Fi speakers, with things like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiele/Small_parameters">Thiele-Small
parameters</a> and <a
href="https://www.audiocircle.com/index.php?topic=46637.0">using the
Golden Ratio for the enclosure dimensions</a>. I spent a while looking
into all of this, but it seemed like the lo-fi and non-linear nature of
guitar speakers means that, at least for a closed-back cabinet that I
was looking to build, the dimensions of the cabinet did not matter
much.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I still opted to start with a golden ratio design
and then work from there to make the cabinet easy to build. I wanted the
cabinet to be 25” wide to match the amp head I built previously, and I
calculated the other dimensions from there. Setting 25” as the long
dimension, this gives dimensions of</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Width: 25”</li>
<li>Height: 25 / 1.6 = 15.625”</li>
<li>Depth: 15.625” x 0.6 = 9.375”</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the 25” measurement was an external one, I wanted to ensure
that there was at least 9” of internal depth to give the speaker plenty
of room relative to the input jack. This fit well with using a pine 1x12
(actual 3/4” by 11 1/4”) for the frame.</p>
<p>Though internal volume is the number that actually makes a difference
in the speaker response, it was easy enough to calculate the external
volume and use that as a point of comparison to other popular 1x12
extension cabinets. The above specs result in an external volume of 4394
in^3, which is less than the huge closed back 1x12 from Emperor, but
also a decent bit larger than the Bogner Cube (although that’s ported
for additional low end response). A large cabinet might have resulted in
a slightly better bass response but again, these things don’t seem to
make much of a difference for guitar speakers and the midrange focus of
electric guitar.</p>
<h2 id="assembly-process">Assembly Process</h2>
<h3 id="frame">Frame</h3>
<p>Cut the 1x12x8’ board into sections of</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>2 x 25” lengths (top and bottom sections)</li>
<li>2 x 14 1/8” lengths (sides)</li>
</ul>
<p>Assemble the four boards as the frame of the cabinet with the sides
sandwiched between the top and bottom.</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li>Drill 3 pilot holes per side through the top of the frame into the
sides.</li>
<li>Remove the top, drill clearance holes for your 2” deck screws
through the pilot holes</li>
<li>Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the bottom of the frame.</li>
<li>Join the frame with the 2” deck screws. Wood glue is optional, I
just used screws.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="baffle-mounts">Baffle Mounts</h3>
<p>Cut the 1x2 furring strips into sections of</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>4 x 23 1/2” lengths (or a bit less, should fit into the frame)</li>
<li>4 x 14 1/8” lengths (or a bit less, should fit vertically into the
frame)</li>
</ul>
<p>Drill 3 clearance holes (for the 1” wood screws) through the 2” width
of each of the furring strips. The exact location of these holes doesn’t
make that much of a difference, it’s just necessary to check before
installing the baffle and back plates that their screws won’t hit these
mounting screws.</p>
<p>Join the front’s furring strips to the frame with the 1” wood screws,
set back from the edge of the frame such that there is 1” between the
edge of the frame and the furring strip. I didn’t use pilot holes for
these furring strips, just drive the screws through the clearance
holes.</p>
<p>Apply the same process for the back’s furring strips, setting them
back 5/8” instead of 1” like for the front.</p>
<h3 id="baffle">Baffle</h3>
<p>Cut 2, 23 1/2” x 14 1/8” sections of the plywood. Set one section
aside for the back.</p>
<p>Use a compass to sketch a 11.1” diameter circle on the center of the
baffle. Use a jigsaw to remove this circle of wood.</p>
<p>Line your speaker up with the baffle hole, ensuring that the speaker
mount holes have sufficient material outside the baffle hole. Mark these
holes, remove the speaker, and drill clearance holes for the 1/4-20
bolts.</p>
<p>Place the baffle into the frame against the furring strips. Drill
clearance holes for the #10 bolts through the baffle and the furring
strips. I put 4 bolts along the top and bottom of the baffle and 3 on
each side. This might be overkill, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Remove the baffle, and counterbore each of the holes to 1” diameter
and about 3/8” depth. I used a drill press for this to prevent the bit
from walking as much. There may not be enough material on most of the
holes to prevent a side of the counterbore hole from being open to the
outside of the piece or the baffle hole, this is alright.</p>
<p>Capture the 4 1/4-20 bolts for the speaker mount, and the 14 #10
bolts for the baffle mounting, in the counterbore holes in the baffle
using their associated nuts + washers.</p>
<p>Once all of the bolts are captured on the baffle, apply grill cloth
over the front (bolt head side) of the baffle. I put a coat of black
spray paint on this side first before applying the grill cloth to make
it harder to see the plywood through the cloth, but up to you on whether
that will make a difference. I fastened the grill cloth with a staple
gun.</p>
<h3 id="final-assembly">Final Assembly</h3>
<p>Place the baffle in its holes in the front of the frame. This might
require a bit of work with a rubber mallet to get it to line up
properly. Use 14 more of the #10 nuts and washers to fasten the bolts
from the inside of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Attach the speaker to its 4 mounting bolts with the remaining 1/4-20
nuts. Attach the 1/4” jack with a spade connectors or solder.</p>
<p>Place the back in the frame. Drill pilot holes into the furring
strips. I used a similar 14 hole pattern as with the baffle. Remove the
back, drill clearance holes for the 1” wood screws and a clearance hole
for the 1/4” jack. Place the back in the frame again, attaching the 1/4”
jack and driving in the wood screws.</p>
<p>The method for attaching the handles will differ by the model you
choose. For the handles I linked above, I measured the indent and
removed that amount of wood from the sides using a jigsaw.</p>
