<p>I crept through your garden Hoping I would feel at ease Being out
here amongst something That I know had brought you peace And I promise
I’ve been trying To do it like you showed me But I have been Rejected by
its leaves</p>
<p>And I know you knew I loved you But I wish I’d said it more Because I
have this awful feeling That you died feeling ignored And it’s so
fucking typical While everybody grieves I find a way to make it about
me</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye And have to do so with a brave face
While the people you look up to Cry and wish they could take your place
Did that make you feel loved Or did it just make you feel guilty That’s
enough I’m not ready to know</p>
<p>And I dragged my Feet across your hallway Hoping I’d melt through the
floor Before I made it to your bedroom And have a stand off with your
door I’ve never been in there without you Who know if it’s even still
there I tuck my tail And retreat downstairs</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye And have to do so with a brave face
While the people you look up to Cry and wish they could take your place
Did that make you feel loved Or did it just make you feel guilty That’s
enough I’m not ready to know</p>
<p>And I Couldn’t be more of a coward If I were to try Cause When you
needed closure I wouldn’t let you say goodbye And I thought that was
noble At least at the time As if you needed someone To tell you you’re
fine As if not letting go of you Would have somehow saved your life</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye And have to do so with a brave face
While the people you look up to Cry and wish they could take your place
Did that make you feel loved Or did it just make you feel guilty That’s
enough I’m not ready to know</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye And have to do so with a brave face
While the people you look up to Cry and wish they could take your place
Did that make you feel loved Or did it just make you feel guilty That’s
enough I don’t ever wanna know</p>
