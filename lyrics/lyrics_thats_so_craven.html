<p>I crept through your garden<br />
Hoping I would feel at ease<br />
Being out here amongst something<br />
That I know had brought you peace<br />
And I promise I’ve been trying<br />
To do it like you showed me<br />
But I have been<br />
Rejected by its leaves<br />
</p>
<p>And I know you knew I loved you<br />
But I wish I’d said it more<br />
Because I have this awful feeling<br />
That you died feeling ignored<br />
And it’s so fucking typical<br />
While everybody grieves<br />
I find a way to make it about me<br />
</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye<br />
And have to do so with a brave face<br />
While the people you look up to<br />
Cry and wish they could take your place<br />
Did that make you feel loved<br />
Or did it just make you feel guilty<br />
That’s enough<br />
I’m not ready to know<br />
</p>
<p>And I dragged my<br />
Feet across your hallway<br />
Hoping I’d melt through the floor<br />
Before I made it to your bedroom<br />
And have a stand off with your door<br />
I’ve never been in there without you<br />
Who know if it’s even still there<br />
I tuck my tail<br />
And retreat downstairs<br />
</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye<br />
And have to do so with a brave face<br />
While the people you look up to<br />
Cry and wish they could take your place<br />
Did that make you feel loved<br />
Or did it just make you feel guilty<br />
That’s enough<br />
I’m not ready to know<br />
</p>
<p>And I<br />
Couldn’t be more of a coward<br />
If I were to try<br />
Cause When you needed closure<br />
I wouldn’t let you say goodbye<br />
And I thought that was noble<br />
At least at the time<br />
As if you needed someone<br />
To tell you you’re fine<br />
As if not letting go of you<br />
Would have somehow saved your life<br />
</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye<br />
And have to do so with a brave face<br />
While the people you look up to<br />
Cry and wish they could take your place<br />
Did that make you feel loved<br />
Or did it just make you feel guilty<br />
That’s enough<br />
I’m not ready to know<br />
</p>
<p>So was it hard to say goodbye<br />
And have to do so with a brave face<br />
While the people you look up to<br />
Cry and wish they could take your place<br />
Did that make you feel loved<br />
Or did it just make you feel guilty<br />
That’s enough<br />
I don’t ever wanna know<br />
