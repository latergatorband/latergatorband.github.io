<p>Woke up with a sad song stuck in my head A crazy case of bittersweet
dread A nasty constant biting affliction Nostalgia is the new
addiction</p>
<p>Walls creak with warmth of the morning And my knees ache from the
concrete floor Subtlety be damned, I’m really tired Need something more
to stoke my fire</p>
<p>I hesitate to say I hate getting older</p>
<p>Even grown ups have to grow up sometimes It’s no surprise to eyes as
weary as mine You could go on and still wonder why All time that’s past
remains by your side What matters most is making the most of it all</p>
<p>I felt a familiar feeling The hole in my heart is still healing A
drop in the temp about a dozen percent A change in the air I’ll never
forget</p>
<p>I hesitate to say I hate getting older Turning the page, finding
value with age The memories should remain Take the weight off your
shoulders</p>
<p>Even grown ups have to grow up sometimes It’s no surprise to eyes as
weary as mine You could go on and still wonder why All time that’s past
remains by your side What matters most is making the most of it all</p>
