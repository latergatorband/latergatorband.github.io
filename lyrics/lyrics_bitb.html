<p>I was lost in the wind<br />
When I found you again<br />
Every spring since then<br />
I have welcomed the breeze again<br />
</p>
<p>I lost my breath into the bargain<br />
Striking a deal with my dreams<br />
I lost myself in the bar again<br />
Nothing changes but me<br />
</p>
<p>Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and<br />
I don’t know where to call our home<br />
Where to call our home<br />
I’ll just call you<br />
</p>
<p>Whether we’re traveling fast or slow<br />
We’ve already laid the track ahead<br />
I hate the change but you long to go<br />
The pause we took here’s just a means to an end<br />
</p>
<p>We caught a glimpse of a better time<br />
I lost my pace, I lost my spine<br />
We’ve barely made it out of town<br />
But somehow I’m ready to slow this down<br />
</p>
<p>Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and<br />
I don’t know where to call our home<br />
Where to call our home<br />
I’ll just call you home<br />
