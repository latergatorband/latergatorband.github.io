<p>I was lost in the wind When I found you again Every spring since then
I have welcomed the breeze again</p>
<p>I lost my breath into the bargain Striking a deal with my dreams I
lost myself in the bar again Nothing changes but me</p>
<p>Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and I don’t know
where to call our home Where to call our home I’ll just call you</p>
<p>Whether we’re traveling fast or slow We’ve already laid the track
ahead I hate the change but you long to go The pause we took here’s just
a means to an end</p>
<p>We caught a glimpse of a better time I lost my pace, I lost my spine
We’ve barely made it out of town But somehow I’m ready to slow this
down</p>
<p>Our lives have been frittered away by the detail and I don’t know
where to call our home Where to call our home I’ll just call you
home</p>
