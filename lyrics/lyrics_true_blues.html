<p>My brain begged my mouth to say<br />
I don’t wanna lose you<br />
Maybe if I said it sooner<br />
This would not have been an issue<br />
But it’s hard so hard<br />
Watching friendships fall apart<br />
Knowing if it’s not the distance<br />
Then at least it’s how it starts<br />
</p>
<p>My lungs implored my hands<br />
To put down the pack of true blues.<br />
I try casting smokescreen<br />
But my excuses are see-through<br />
I don’t want to make things hard<br />
I’m just spineless and I’m confused<br />
Sending signals in the dark<br />
And acting shocked they don’t get seen too<br />
</p>
<p>I’ve been smoking Cigarettes<br />
To spend time with your Silhouette<br />
Cause I’m nervous I’ll forget<br />
What you looked like if I quit<br />
</p>
<p>You used to talk about<br />
What our lives would look like on TV<br />
I thought my role would be boring<br />
But you always disagreed<br />
What a shame they wrote you off<br />
When you were only thirty-three<br />
Really think you would have shined<br />
With some more time on our screen<br />
</p>
<p>I’ve been smoking Cigarettes<br />
To spend time with your Silhouette<br />
Cause I’m nervous I’ll forget<br />
What you looked like if I quit<br />
