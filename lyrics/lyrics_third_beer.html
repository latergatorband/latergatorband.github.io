<p>I’m just the third beer you had last night<br />
A forgotten step along the way<br />
From here to a better time<br />
Like it could ever stay the same<br />
I’m far too concerned with consistency<br />
Eat the lotus and leave me behind<br />
The apathy is yours<br />
And the memories are now<br />
Only mine<br />
<br />
Fuck this<br />
I would have thought by now<br />
I wouldn’t be getting left out of<br />
Everything we do<br />
I wish<br />
I would have learned by now<br />
To stop seeking validation<br />
From those don’t give a single shit about me<br />
I’m still<br />
A nearly limitless<br />
Pool for your expectations<br />
And I am damn near done<br />
<br />
Even with all of us in the same room<br />
It doesn’t feel the same anymore<br />
I used to act the oldest in the group<br />
But I haven’t aged a day in years<br />
Foolishly convinced that to stay the same is the key<br />
For friends to stay with me<br />
<br />
I’m just the third beer you had last night<br />
A forgotten step along the way<br />
From here to a better time<br />
Like it could ever stay the same<br />
I know you’ll keep staying out on your island<br />
And I’ll keep staying in on mine<br />
Trying to find some joy in<br />
(Even when I’m always there, I’m still)<br />
Missing out<br />
