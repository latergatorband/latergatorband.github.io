<p>I’m just the third beer you had last night A forgotten step along the
way From here to a better time Like it could ever stay the same I’m far
too concerned with consistency Eat the lotus and leave me behind The
apathy is yours And the memories are now Only mine</p>
<p>Fuck this I would have thought by now I wouldn’t be getting left out
of Everything we do I wish I would have learned by now To stop seeking
validation From those don’t give a single shit about me I’m still A
nearly limitless Pool for your expectations And I am damn near done</p>
<p>Even with all of us in the same room It doesn’t feel the same anymore
I used to act the oldest in the group But I haven’t aged a day in years
Foolishly convinced that to stay the same is the key For friends to stay
with me</p>
<p>I’m just the third beer you had last night A forgotten step along the
way From here to a better time Like it could ever stay the same I know
you’ll keep staying out on your island And I’ll keep staying in on mine
Trying to find some joy in (Even when I’m always there, I’m still)
Missing out</p>
