<p>I wish I could sleep all night<br />
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff<br />
I wish I could put up a fight<br />
Until I can figure this shit out<br />
I’ll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights<br />
It’s getting bad again<br />
<br />
I’m losing track of where I’ve been<br />
Trying harder to form sentences<br />
I take forever to type<br />
My words aren’t right<br />
Already guilty I won’t make sense<br />
<br />
I’m losing weight again<br />
I’m carrying too much tension in my face<br />
I’m learning to smile softer<br />
My clothes hang harder<br />
I can’t keep up this pace<br />
<br />
A broken clock<br />
Proud of myself<br />
For being right on the second pass<br />
And refusing all your help<br />
This mental atrophy<br />
From prescription crutches in my brain<br />
You think that I’m a mosaic when all I am<br />
Is just shattered glass<br />
<br />
I wish I could sleep all night<br />
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff<br />
I wish I could put up a fight<br />
Until I can figure this shit out<br />
I’ll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights<br />
<br />
I wish I could sleep all night<br />
I thought I was smart but they called my bluff<br />
I wish I could put up a fight<br />
Until I can figure this shit out<br />
I’ll keep making coffee at ten to start my nights<br />
It’s getting bad again<br />
